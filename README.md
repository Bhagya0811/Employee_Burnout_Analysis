# Employee Burnout Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee burnout predictors using machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify key stress indicators, visualize burnout trends, and develop predictive models to help organizations proactively manage employee wellness and reduce burnout risk.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Identify Burnout Predictors** - Analyze which factors contribute most to employee burnout
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Visualize relationships between work conditions and burnout levels
3. **Predictive Modeling** - Build classification models to identify at-risk employees
4. **Actionable Insights** - Provide HR departments with data-driven recommendations

## 📈 Key Features

✅ **Comprehensive EDA** - In-depth analysis of burnout correlations and patterns  
✅ **Data Visualization** - Interactive charts showing burnout distributions and trends  
✅ **Burnout Classification** - ML models to predict burnout risk levels  
✅ **Feature Analysis** - Identification of key stress factors (work hours, satisfaction, etc.)  
✅ **Business Insights** - Actionable recommendations for HR and management  
✅ **Reproducible Workflow** - Well-documented Jupyter notebooks

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning models (Classification)
- **Scipy** - Statistical analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bhagya0811/Employee_Burnout_Analysis.git
cd Employee_Burnout_Analysis

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

### Running the Analysis

```bash
# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Open 'Employee Burnout Analysis.ipynb' to explore the analysis
```

## 📌 Key Findings

The analysis reveals:
- Strong correlation between work hours and burnout risk
- Job satisfaction is a significant predictor of burnout
- Mental exhaustion is the primary burnout indicator
- Specific departments show higher burnout rates
- Early intervention opportunities identified through predictive modeling

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Implemented classifiers include:
- Logistic Regression
